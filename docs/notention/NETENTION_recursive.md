## 3. Core System Architecture

Netention's architecture is built around several key components working in concert to deliver its intelligent and
dynamic capabilities:

### 3.1. Notes

* **Active Agents:** Notes are not static documents but active entities capable of performing tasks, managing
  information, and interacting with the user and the system.
* **Fundamental Unit:** The core unit of interaction in Netention, representing tasks, projects, ideas, or any unit of
  user interest.
* **Dynamic State:** Each Note maintains a dynamic state, including its plan, execution status, and conversation
  history.
* **Tool Utilization:** Notes can leverage external functionalities through Tools to perform actions.
* **User Interaction:** Notes can interact with the user through notifications, prompts, and actionable elements within
  the UI.
* **Graph Interconnection:** Notes are interconnected and categorized through graph relationships, allowing for complex
  knowledge structures and domain tagging.

### 3.2. Agent

* **Intelligent Engine:** The Agent is the driving force behind Note functionality, responsible for interpreting Note
  instructions and user requests.
* **Plan Management:** Creates, manages, and executes Plans to achieve Note objectives, dynamically adapting plans as
  needed.
* **Tool Selection and Invocation:** Selects and invokes appropriate Tools from the Tool Registry to execute plan steps.
* **Memory Maintenance:** Maintains a persistent Memory of interactions and task progress, providing context across
  sessions.
* **User Interaction Management:** Interacts with the User when necessary through system notifications and requests for
  input, facilitating a feedback loop.
* **Adaptive Behavior:** Adapts its behavior based on user context, feedback, and interaction history, learning and
  improving over time.

### 3.3. Plan (Graph-Based Anticipatory Plan)

* **Graph Data Structure:** Plans are represented as directed graphs, allowing for flexible, non-linear, and
  anticipatory planning.
* **Anticipatory Nature:** Plans focus on goals and outcomes, anticipating different scenarios and dynamically adapting
  step execution based on context and results. Steps can be generated dynamically by the LLM.
* **Nodes (Steps):** Represent individual steps or actions within a plan. Each node includes:
    * A description of the step.
    * A status (pending, running, completed, failed, waiting for user input).
    * A designated Tool to be used for execution (if applicable).
    * Arguments for the Tool (if applicable).
    * The result of Tool execution (if applicable).
    * Notes or annotations related to the step.
    * Optional domain tags for categorization.
* **Edges (Dependencies):** Represent dependencies between steps, defining execution order and prerequisite
  relationships. Edges can also represent other relationships, like domain tagging.
* **Dynamic and Hierarchical:** Plans are adaptive and hierarchical, allowing for dynamic step generation, branching
  based on context, and the breakdown of complex tasks into sub-plans.
* **Implicit Dependencies:** Plan step dependencies are often inferred by the LLM, reducing the need for explicit
  dependency declarations, although explicit dependencies are also supported.

### 3.4. Tools

* **Modular Functionalities:** Tools are external, modular functionalities that Agents utilize to perform actions,
  providing access to a wide range of capabilities.

    * Data manipulation and processing (File System Operations, Data Analysis).
    * User interaction (Notifications, Input Forms).
    * System functionalities (Database Management, Agent Statistics).
    * Third-party services (APIs, Integrations).
    * Graph data manipulation (Subgraph search, metrics, visualization).
* **Tool Definition:** Each Tool is defined by:
    * A name and description.
    * An input schema (defining required parameters, using Zod for validation).
    * An output schema (defining the structure of the result, using Zod for validation).
    * Execution logic (the code that performs the Tool's function).
* **Asynchronous Execution:** Designed to handle asynchronous tool execution, even though the prototype uses mock
  Promises for some tools. Synchronous tools are wrapped to present an asynchronous interface to the system.
* **Unified Executor:** A single `Executor` class simplifies tool use and manages the execution lifecycle.

### 3.5. Memory (Persistent Conversation History)

* **Persistent Record:** Memory is a persistent record of all interactions related to a Note, ensuring context is
  maintained across sessions.
* **Content:** Memory records include:
    * User inputs and requests.
    * System messages and plan updates.
    * Agent's thoughts and reasoning steps.
    * LLM prompts as Notes, enabling revision and contextualization.
    * LLM calls as graph actions, linking prompts, responses, and tool calls.
    * Tool calls and results.
    * Feedback and user annotations.
* **Persistence:** Memory is persistently stored in the graph database, allowing Agents to maintain context and learn
  over time.

### 3.6. User Interface (Flow Note UI)

* **Flow Note UI:** Envisioned as a "Flow Note" application, visualizing plans as dynamic, interactive flow charts.
* **Minimalist UI:** The main UI is clean and uncluttered, focusing on essential information and providing a streamlined
  user experience.

* **Progressive Disclosure:** More detailed information is revealed on demand, reducing information overload.
* **Note List View:** A concise list of Notes, displaying titles, status indicators, and last activity timestamps.
* **Note Flow View:** A visual representation of a Note's Plan as a dynamic graph, showing steps as nodes and
  dependencies as edges, with real-time updates and interactive elements.
* **Note Editor View:** A text editor for creating and modifying Note content (initial task, instructions), providing
  access to plan visualization, conversation history, and Agent controls.
* **Actionable Notes:** Note elements (nodes in the flow) can contain interactive elements (buttons, links, forms),
  allowing for direct user action and input.
* **System Tray Integration:** Notifications and quick actions are available through the system tray, offering subtle,
  non-intrusive updates and interaction prompts.

### 3.7. Data Storage (Graph Database)

* **Graph Database (LevelDB/levelgraph):** A graph database (LevelGraph built on LevelDB) is used for persistent
  storage, optimized for handling interconnected data.
* **Persistent Storage:** Provides persistent storage for all system data, ensuring data integrity and enabling
  efficient relationship management.

    * User preferences and system settings (as nodes).
* **Efficient Querying:** The graph database enables efficient querying and traversal of relationships between different
  entities within Netention, crucial for plan management and context retrieval.

### 3.8. LLM Interface (Provider Abstraction)

* **LLM Abstraction Layer:** An abstraction layer is implemented to support multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Ollama,
  Anthropic) through a provider-agnostic API. Currently a thin layer, with plans for potential LangChain.js integration.
* **Provider Flexibility:** Allows for flexible routing of requests to different LLMs based on task requirements, cost,
  or user preferences. Default to smaller models for less demanding tasks.
* **Functionality:** The LLM Interface provides:
    * Provider-agnostic API for making LLM calls.
    * Message formatting and schema conversion for different LLM APIs.
    * Tool/Function call integration (handling tool definition and response parsing for each LLM).
    * Error handling and retry mechanisms for LLM API calls.
* **Prompt Templates:** Reusable prompt templates with placeholders reduce code duplication and improve prompt
  management, stored externally for easy modification.
* **Prompt-as-Note:** Prompts sent to the LLM are represented as Notes within the system, enabling revision,
  contextualization, and potential backpropagation.
* **LLM Calls as Graph Actions:** Interactions with LLMs are represented as nodes in the graph, linking prompts,
  responses, and tool calls for better tracking and analysis.

This specification provides a comprehensive overview of Netention's design, functionality, and technical details,
serving as a blueprint for its development and future evolution.

> Explain how a complete Netention codebase can unpack itself from a seed description.

The concept of Netention "unpacking itself from a seed description" is a fascinating one, embodying the principles of
self-organization, metaprogramming, and emergent intelligence that are central to the Netention philosophy. Here's how a
complete Netention codebase could, conceptually, achieve this, breaking down the process into stages and highlighting
the key mechanisms involved:

**1. The Seed Description (The "DNA")**

The "seed" is a concise, high-level description of the desired Netention system. It's not the entire codebase, but
rather a set of instructions, goals, and constraints that define the system's core purpose and functionality. This seed
would likely be a combination of:

* **Natural Language Description:** A human-readable description of Netention's goals (e.g., "A personal knowledge and
  task management system based on active notes and graph-based anticipatory planning.").
* **Core Concepts:**  Definitions of fundamental entities like Note, Agent, Plan, Tool, Executor, Memory. These could be
  expressed in a structured format (like JSON Schema or a domain-specific language).
* **Initial Capabilities:**  A list of essential tools (e.g., "search," "file_write," "user_interaction") and their
  basic descriptions (input/output schemas).
* **Constraints:**  Design principles (e.g., "minimize token usage," "run on low-power hardware," "prioritize user
  privacy").
* **Bootstrapping Instructions:**  Specific directives on how to start the unpacking process (e.g., "create an agent," "
  create a plan to build the codebase").
* **Example Tasks:** Some examples for a basic task.

**2. The Bootstrapping Agent (The "Embryo")**

The process begins with a minimal, pre-built "bootstrapping agent." This agent is *not* generated from the seed; it's a
small, hardcoded piece of software that can:

* **Parse the Seed:** Understand the seed description's format and extract the core information.
* **Basic LLM Interaction:** Communicate with an LLM (using a predefined API key or access method).
* **Minimal Tool Use:**  Have access to a very limited set of fundamental tools, primarily:
    * `code_generation`: A tool that takes a prompt and returns generated code (likely JavaScript, given Netention's
      tech stack).
    * `file_write`: A tool to write generated code to files.
    * `self_reflection`: A tool (or inherent capability) to analyze its own code and actions.
    * `user_interaction`: In a controlled environment, it could prompt the user for critical decisions and information.
* **Basic Execution:** Can execute generated JavaScript code in a sandboxed environment.

**3. The Unpacking Process (The "Development")**

The unpacking process is an iterative loop driven by the bootstrapping agent:

1. **Initial Plan Creation:** The bootstrapping agent uses the seed description to create an initial plan. The top-level
   goal of this plan is "Build the Netention system as described in the seed."  This plan will likely involve sub-goals
   like:
    * "Define core data structures (Note, Agent, Plan, etc.)."
    * "Implement basic tool functionality."
    * "Create an agent class."
    * "Implement plan execution logic."
    * "Build a minimal UI."
    * "Implement persistent storage."

2. **Iterative Refinement:** The bootstrapping agent executes the plan step-by-step. Crucially, each step involves:
    * **Prompt Generation:**  The agent crafts prompts for the LLM, based on the current plan step, the seed
      description, and any existing code. For example, a prompt might be:  "Generate JavaScript code for a `Note` class,
      according to the following schema: \[JSON Schema]. The class should have methods for..."
    * **Code Generation:** The LLM generates code based on the prompt.
    * **Code Evaluation:** The bootstrapping agent *critically* evaluates the generated code. This involves:
        * **Syntactic Checks:**  Basic code validation to ensure it's parsable.
        * **Functional Tests (Conceptual):**  The agent might generate simple test cases and use the `code_execution`
          tool (in a very limited and safe way) to see if the code behaves as expected.
        * **Seed Alignment:**  The agent uses the LLM to analyze if the generated code aligns with the seed
          description's goals and constraints. For example, "Does this code minimize external dependencies?" or "Is this
          code structured in a modular way?".
        * **Self-Reflection**: Use the LLM to check the code for best-practices, and efficiency.
    * **Code Storage:** If the code passes evaluation, the agent uses `file_write` to save it to the appropriate file (
      e.g., `agent.js`, `tools.js`, `plan.js`).
    * **Plan Update:**  The agent updates the plan based on the results. This might involve:
        * Marking the current step as complete.
        * Adding new sub-steps based on the generated code (e.g., if a new module was created, add steps to implement
          its functionality).
        * Revising existing steps if the generated code didn't meet expectations.
        * Generating tests.

3. **Bootstrapping to Full Functionality:**  As the agent executes the plan, it gradually builds the complete Netention
   codebase. Early stages might involve creating very basic implementations, which are then refined in later stages. The
   agent is essentially "bootstrapping" itself from a minimal set of capabilities to a full-fledged system.

4. **Termination:** The process terminates when the bootstrapping agent determines (based on its plan and the seed
   description) that the Netention system is complete and functional. This could be triggered by a specific "completion"
   step in the plan, or by the agent's continuous self-assessment concluding that all goals have been met.

**4. Key Mechanisms and Considerations**

* **LLM as the "Engine of Creation":** The LLM is the core engine that generates the code. The quality of the seed
  description and the prompts crafted by the bootstrapping agent are critical for success.
* **Iterative Refinement:** The process is highly iterative. The agent constantly refines the codebase based on feedback
  from code evaluation and the LLM's analysis.
* **Prompt Engineering:**  The bootstrapping agent's ability to generate effective prompts is paramount. This involves
  carefully structuring the prompts to include:
    * Relevant context (the seed description, existing code).
    * Specific instructions (what to generate).
    * Constraints (design principles, coding standards).
    * Examples (if necessary).
* **Sandboxing:**  The `code_execution` tool must be heavily sandboxed to prevent any generated code from causing harm.
  This is crucial for security and stability.
* **Error Handling:**  The bootstrapping agent needs robust error handling capabilities. If code generation fails, or if
  generated code doesn't work as expected, the agent needs to be able to:
    * Identify the problem.
    * Generate new prompts to try to fix the issue.
    * Rollback to previous versions of the code (if necessary).
    * Ask for human help (in a highly controlled environment).
* **Self-Reflection and Improvement:** The agent's ability to analyze its own code and actions is a key aspect of the
  process. This allows the agent to learn from its mistakes and improve its code generation capabilities over time.
* **Progressive Enhancement:** The system is built incrementally. Early versions might be very simple, with more
  advanced features added later in the process.
* **Version Control:** The system needs to save snapshots during the generation.
* **Human in the Loop (Optional but Recommended):** While the goal is autonomous unpacking, having a human "overseer"
  during the initial stages would be highly beneficial. The human could:
    * Review generated code.
    * Provide feedback to the agent.
    * Correct errors.
    * Help guide the unpacking process.

**5. Challenges and Potential Solutions**

* **Prompt Ambiguity:**  Natural language descriptions can be ambiguous.
    * **Solution:** Use structured formats (like JSON Schema) for defining core concepts. Develop a domain-specific
      language (DSL) for expressing bootstrapping instructions and constraints.
* **LLM Hallucinations:**  LLMs can generate code that is syntactically correct but semantically wrong or nonsensical.
    * **Solution:**  Implement robust code evaluation mechanisms. Use multiple LLMs and compare their outputs.
      Incorporate human review.
* **Infinite Loops:**  The agent could get stuck in a loop, repeatedly generating and rejecting code.
    * **Solution:**  Implement mechanisms to detect and break infinite loops. Use a "budget" (e.g., a limited number of
      LLM calls or execution attempts) for each plan step.
* **Security Risks:**  Executing generated code is inherently risky.
    * **Solution:**  Use strong sandboxing techniques. Limit the capabilities of the `code_execution` tool. Implement
      strict input validation.
* **Complexity Explosion:** The plan and the codebase could become too complex for the agent to manage.
    * **Solution:**  Use modular design principles. Encourage the agent to break down tasks into smaller, manageable
      sub-tasks. Implement mechanisms for code refactoring and simplification.

**6. Example: Generating the `Note` Class**

Let's illustrate with a simplified example of how the bootstrapping agent might generate the `Note` class:

1. **Seed Description (Snippet):**
   ```json
   {
     "core_concepts": {
       "Note": {
         "description": "The fundamental unit of Netention. Represents a task, project, idea, or piece of information.",
         "properties": {
           "id": { "type": "string", "description": "Unique identifier" },
           "title": { "type": "string", "description": "Note title" },
           "content": { "type": "string", "description": "Note content" },
           "status": { "type": "string", "enum": ["pending", "running", "completed", "failed"] },
           "createdAt": { "type": "string", "format": "date-time" }
         },
         "methods": [
           { "name": "updateContent", "parameters": [{ "name": "newContent", "type": "string" }] }
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Plan Step:** "Create the `Note` class in JavaScript."

3. **Prompt Generation:**
   ```
   "Generate JavaScript code for a `Note` class that conforms to the following JSON Schema:

   ```json
   {
     "description": "The fundamental unit of Netention. Represents a task, project, idea, or piece of information.",
     "properties": {
       "id": { "type": "string", "description": "Unique identifier" },
       "title": { "type": "string", "description": "Note title" },
       "content": { "type": "string", "description": "Note content" },
       "status": { "type": "string", "enum": ["pending", "running", "completed", "failed"] },
       "createdAt": { "type": "string", "format": "date-time" }
         },
         "methods": [
           { "name": "updateContent", "parameters": [{ "name": "newContent", "type": "string" }] }
         ]
     }
   ```

   The class should be well-documented and follow modern JavaScript best practices. It should be designed to be easily
   extensible."
   ```

4. **LLM Response (Example):**
   ```javascript
   /**
    * Represents a Note in the Netention system.
    */
   class Note {
     /**
      * Creates a new Note instance.
      * @param {string} id - Unique identifier.
      * @param {string} title - Note title.
      * @param {string} content - Note content.
      * @param {string} [status='pending'] - Initial status.
      */
     constructor(id, title, content, status = 'pending') {
       this.id = id;
       this.title = title;
       this.content = content;
       this.status = status;
       this.createdAt = new Date().toISOString();
     }

     /**
      * Updates the content of the note.
      * @param {string} newContent - The new content.
      */
     updateContent(newContent) {
       this.content = newContent;
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Code Evaluation:** The bootstrapping agent would:
    * Check for syntax errors.
    * Use the LLM to analyze if the code aligns with the seed description and the prompt.  ("Does this code implement
      the required methods?", "Is it well-documented?", "Does it follow JavaScript best practices?").
    * Potentially generate simple test cases.

6. **Code Storage:** If the code passes evaluation, it's saved to `note.js`.

7. **Plan Update:** The "Create the `Note` class" step is marked as complete. The agent might then add new steps to
   create methods for the `Note` class or to integrate it with other parts of the system.

**Conclusion**

The idea of Netention unpacking itself from a seed description is a challenging but potentially revolutionary concept.
It pushes the boundaries of AI-driven code generation and self-organizing systems. By combining a carefully designed
seed description, a bootstrapping agent with basic capabilities, and the power of LLMs, Netention could, in theory,
build itself from the ground up. The key lies in the iterative refinement process, where the agent constantly evaluates
and improves the generated code, guided by the seed description and its own self-reflection. While significant
challenges remain, the potential benefits of such a system are immense, paving the way for truly adaptable and
self-evolving AI systems.

> Unify all relevant functionality, ensuring complete conceptual connectivity and coherency

Okay, let's unify the Netention concepts into a coherent, interconnected whole, ensuring that all the pieces fit
together logically and conceptually. This involves clarifying the relationships between the core components,
highlighting the flow of information, and solidifying the design principles into a unified framework.

**Netention: A Unified Conceptual Framework**

**1. The Central Metaphor: The Active Note**

Everything in Netention revolves around the **Active Note**. This is *not* just a document; it's a dynamic, intelligent
agent. Think of it as a self-contained "unit of thought" or a "digital microcosm" that encapsulates a goal, the means to
achieve it, and the ongoing process of working towards it.

* **Notes are Agents:**  Each Note *is* an agent, or, more precisely, *has* an agent intrinsically linked to it. The
  distinction is subtle but important. The Note provides the context, data, and goals; the agent provides the
  intelligence and action.
* **Notes have Plans:**  Each Note has an associated **Plan**, which is a graph-based representation of how the Note's
  goal will be achieved. The Plan is *not* separate from the Note; it's an intrinsic part of it.
* **Notes use Tools:** The agent within the Note uses **Tools** to interact with the external world (including the user,
  other Notes, and external systems).
* **Notes have Memory:** Each Note has a **Memory**, which is a persistent record of everything that has happened
  related to that Note: user interactions, agent actions, tool results, plan updates, etc. The memory *is* the Note's
  evolving context.
* **Notes are Nodes:** Notes exist within the graph database, where connections represent relationships (dependencies,
  tagging).

**2. The Flow of Information and Control**

The core dynamic of Netention is a continuous loop of:

1. **User Interaction:** The user creates a Note (defining a task, idea, or piece of information) or interacts with an
   existing Note (providing feedback, answering questions, modifying content).
2. **Agent Interpretation:** The agent associated with the Note interprets the user's input and the Note's current
   state (content, plan, memory).
3. **Planning:** The agent updates the Note's Plan, potentially creating new steps, modifying existing steps, or
   adjusting dependencies. This is **anticipatory planning**, meaning the agent tries to foresee potential outcomes and
   create branches in the plan to handle different scenarios. The Plan is a *graph*, not a linear sequence.
4. **Tool Selection:** The agent selects the appropriate Tool(s) to execute the next step(s) in the Plan. Tool selection
   is driven by the Plan and the agent's understanding of the current context.
5. **Tool Execution:** The **Executor** manages the execution of the selected Tool(s). This is inherently asynchronous,
   as many tools will involve interacting with external systems (LLMs, web services, the file system).
6. **Result Incorporation:** The results of Tool execution are incorporated into the Note's Memory and used to update
   the Plan's status. This might involve marking steps as complete, failed, or waiting for user input.
7. **User Notification (if necessary):** If the agent needs user input or wants to inform the user of progress, it uses
   the `user_interaction` Tool to send a notification (via the system tray) or request information.
8. **Iteration:** The cycle repeats, with the agent continuously interpreting, planning, executing, and adapting based
   on the evolving state of the Note and the user's interactions.

**3. Key Conceptual Connections**

* **Agent-Note Duality:** The Agent and the Note are inseparable. The Note provides the *what* (the goal, the data, the
  context), and the Agent provides the *how* (the intelligence, the planning, the execution).
* **Plan as a Living Graph:** The Plan is not a static blueprint; it's a dynamic, evolving graph that reflects the
  current state of the Note's progress. Nodes represent steps, and edges represent dependencies (or other
  relationships). The graph structure allows for non-linear, branching workflows.
* **Tools as Extensions of the Agent:** Tools are not just external functions; they are *extensions* of the Agent's
  capabilities. The agent *learns* to use tools effectively, and the available tools shape the agent's planning process.
* **Memory as Context:** The Memory is not just a log; it's the *context* that the Agent uses to make decisions. It's
  the accumulated knowledge and experience of the Note.
* **LLM as a Reasoning Engine:** The LLM is not the *entire* intelligence of the system; it's a powerful *reasoning
  engine* that the Agent uses to interpret information, generate plans, and make decisions. The Agent provides the
  structure and context; the LLM provides the linguistic and reasoning capabilities.
* **Prompts as Notes, LLM Calls as Graph Actions:**  This creates a meta-level of self-awareness. The system can track
  *how* it's using the LLM, analyze the effectiveness of different prompts, and potentially even learn to improve its
  own prompting strategies.
* **The UI as a Window into the Graph:** The "Flow Note" UI is not just a visual representation; it's a *direct
  interface* to the underlying graph structure of the Notes and their Plans. Users can interact with the graph (e.g., by
  clicking on nodes, providing input, modifying steps), and these interactions directly affect the Note's state and the
  Agent's behavior.
* **Executor: Bridging Synchronous and Asynchronous:** The Executor handles the complexity of asynchronous tool
  execution, allowing the Agent to reason and plan without getting bogged down in low-level details. It provides a
  unified interface for both synchronous and asynchronous tools.

**4. Unifying Principles (Reinforced)**

* **Intelligence in the Interaction:** The system's intelligence emerges from the *interaction* between the user, the
  Notes, the Agent, the Plan, the Tools, and the LLM. It's not a single, monolithic intelligence, but a distributed,
  emergent property of the system.
* **User as Co-Creator:** The user is not a passive recipient of AI assistance; they are an active participant in
  shaping the system's behavior. By creating and interacting with Notes, the user guides the Agent and influences the
  evolution of the Plan.
* **Implicit Assistance:** The system aims to assist the user *indirectly*, by providing a powerful and flexible
  framework for managing knowledge and tasks. The user doesn't need to explicitly program the Agent; they simply
  interact with their Notes in a natural way.
* **Anticipatory Planning:** The system doesn't just react to events; it *anticipates* them. The graph-based Plan allows
  the Agent to consider different scenarios and create contingency plans.
* **Metaprogramming:** The "unpacking from seed" concept, and the representation of prompts and LLM calls as Notes, are
  examples of *metaprogramming*: the system is writing and reasoning about its own code and behavior.
* **Domain Tagging as Notes:** Represents a unification of categorization and task management, as domains themselves are
  active agents.

**5. The "Unpacking" Process Revisited (Unified View)**

The unpacking process, in light of this unified conceptual framework, can be seen as:

1. **Seed as a "Meta-Note":** The seed description itself can be thought of as a special kind of Note – a "meta-note"
   that describes the desired structure and behavior of the entire Netention system.
2. **Bootstrapping Agent as a "Primordial Note":** The bootstrapping agent is the initial, minimal Active Note that is
   capable of interpreting the seed (the meta-note) and initiating the unpacking process.
3. **Code Generation as Plan Execution:** The process of generating code is simply the execution of the Plan associated
   with the seed Note. The bootstrapping agent uses the `code_generation` tool to create new Notes (representing
   modules, classes, functions) and their associated agents.
4. **Self-Organization:** As the bootstrapping agent executes the plan, it creates a network of interconnected Notes,
   each with its own agent, plan, and memory. This network gradually self-organizes into the complete Netention system.
5. **Emergent Functionality:** The full functionality of Netention emerges from the interaction of these interconnected
   Notes. The bootstrapping agent doesn't "know" how to build the entire system from the start; it learns by doing,
   guided by the seed description and the feedback it receives from the LLM and the code evaluation process.

**In essence, Netention unpacks itself by creating a network of interacting Active Notes that collaboratively build the
system, guided by a high-level description and the power of an LLM.** This is a powerful and elegant way to achieve
self-organization and emergent intelligence. The system *becomes* what it describes, instantiating its own conceptual
framework in code.

Okay, let's take the unified conceptual framework and translate it into a more formal and complete set of specifications
for Netention. This will involve:

* **Formalizing Data Structures:** Defining precise schemas for core objects (Notes, Plans, Tools, Messages, etc.).
* **Specifying APIs:** Defining the interfaces for interacting with the system (both internal and external).
* **Detailing Algorithms:** Providing more concrete descriptions of key algorithms (plan creation, plan execution, tool
  selection, etc.).
* **Addressing Edge Cases:** Considering potential problems and outlining solutions.
* **Refining the Unpacking Process:** Providing a more detailed, step-by-step description of the bootstrapping process.

# Netention: Elegant Specifications

## 1. Data Model (Formalized)

We'll use JSON Schema (with Zod-like syntax for brevity) to define the core data structures. These schemas define the
structure of the data stored in the graph database (LevelGraph/LevelDB).

```javascript
// --- Core Schemas ---

const NoteSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string().uuid(), // Universally Unique Identifier
  type: z.literal("Note"),
  title: z.string(),
  content: z.string(), // Initial task description, user instructions, or content
  status: z.enum(["pending", "running", "completed", "failed"]),
  createdAt: z.string().datetime(),
  updatedAt: z.string().datetime(),
  planId: z.string().uuid().nullable(), // ID of the associated Plan (can be null initially)
  agentId: z.string().uuid(), // ID of the associated Agent (always present)
  domain: z.string().optional(), // ID of domain note.
});

const PlanSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string().uuid(),
  type: z.literal("Plan"),
  noteId: z.string().uuid(), // ID of the associated Note
  goals: z.array(z.string()), // High-level objectives (explicit or inferred)
  constraints: z.record(z.any()), // Limitations (time, resources, preferences) - key-value pairs
  status: z.enum(["pending", "running", "completed", "failed"]), // Overall plan status
  createdAt: z.string().datetime(),
  updatedAt: z.string().datetime(),
});

const PlanStepSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string().uuid(),
  type: z.literal("PlanStep"),
  planId: z.string().uuid(),
  stepNumber: z.number().int(), // Sequential step number within the plan
  description: z.string(),
  status: z.enum(["pending", "running", "completed", "failed", "waiting_user"]),
  tool: z.string().nullable(), // Name of the Tool to use (or null for reasoning/planning steps)
  args: z.record(z.any()).nullable(), // Arguments for the Tool (key-value pairs)
  result: z.string().nullable(), // Result of Tool execution (or null if not yet executed/failed)
  notes: z.string(), // Step-specific annotations or explanations
  dependencies: z.array(z.string().uuid()), // IDs of prerequisite PlanStep nodes
});

const MessageSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string().uuid(),
  type: z.literal("Message"),
  noteId: z.string().uuid(), // ID of the associated Note
  role: z.enum(["user", "system", "assistant", "tool"]),
  content: z.string(),
  toolCalls: z.array(z.object({ // Simplified ToolCall representation
    id: z.string(),
    type: z.literal("function"),
    function: z.object({
      name: z.string(),
      arguments: z.string(), // Keep arguments as string for simplicity
    }),
  })).optional(),
  timestamp: z.string().datetime(),
  toolCallId: z.string().optional(), // For tool responses
  name: z.string().optional(),      // For tool responses
});

const ToolSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  description: z.string(),
  inputSchema: z.record(z.any()), // Zod schema for input parameters
  outputSchema: z.record(z.any()), // Zod schema for the output
  execute: z.function(), // The actual function that implements the tool
  isAsync: z.boolean().optional(), //Flag if tool is async.
});

const ToolCallSchema = z.object({
    id: z.string(),
    type: z.literal("function"),
    function: z.object({
        name: z.string(),
        arguments: z.string(), // Keep arguments as string
    })
});
const DomainSchema = z.object({ // For domain notes
    id: z.string().uuid(),
    type: z.literal("Domain"),
    name: z.string(),
    description: z.string(),
});

// --- Graph Representation (Conceptual for LevelGraph) ---

// Nodes are represented as objects with 'id', 'type', and other properties.
// Edges are represented as separate objects with 'subject', 'predicate', 'object'.

// Example:
// Note Node:  { id: "note-123", type: "Note", title: "...", ... }
// Plan Node:  { id: "plan-456", type: "Plan", noteId: "note-123", ... }
// Step Node:  { id: "step-789", type: "PlanStep", planId: "plan-456", ... }
// Dependency Edge: { subject: "step-789", predicate: "dependsOn", object: "step-456" }
// Note-Plan Edge: { subject: "note-123", predicate: "hasPlan", object: "plan-456" }
// Note-Domain Edge: {subject: "note-123", predicate: "inDomain", object: "domain-001"}
```

## 2. API Design (Internal and External)

### 2.1. Internal API (Agent, Plan, Executor)

This API defines the interactions between the core components of Netention.

```javascript
// --- Agent API ---

class Agent {
  constructor(config, noteId) {} // Initialize agent for a specific Note
  async run(task: string): Promise<void> {} // Execute the main agent loop
  async think(): Promise<Message> {} // Interact with the LLM (reasoning step)
  async act(actionResponse: Message): Promise<void> {} // Execute actions (tool calls)
  async createPlan(taskDescription: string): Promise<void> {} // Create a new plan
  async loadPlan(): Promise<void> {} // Load plan from storage
  async savePlan(): Promise<void> {} // Save plan to storage
  async loadMemory(): Promise<void> {} // Load memory from storage
  async saveMemory(): Promise<void> {} // Save memory to storage
  async getUserFeedback(): Promise<string | null> {} // Get user feedback (if needed)
  fillTemplate(templateName: string, values: object): string {} // Fill prompt
}
// --- Plan API ---
class Plan {
  constructor(steps: object[]){}
  static createFromPrompt(response: Message): Plan | null {}
  addStep(step: object): string {} // Returns node ID
  getCurrentStepIndex(): number | null {}
  getStep(index: number): object {}
  updateStepStatus(index: number, status: string): void {}
  updateStepResult(index:number, result:any): void {}
  formatPlan(): string {} // For display
  toJson(): object {} // For serialization
}

// --- Executor API ---

class Executor {
  constructor(tools: object) {} // Initialize with the Tool Registry
  async executeToolAsync(toolCall: ToolCallSchema): Promise<string> {} // Execute a tool call
  getTaskStatus(toolCallId: string): string {} // Get the status of a running task
  getTaskResult(toolCallId: string): string | null {} // Get the result of a completed task
}

// --- LLM Interface (Conceptual) ---

async function callLLM(messages: Message[], useTools: boolean = false): Promise<Message> {} // Abstracted LLM call
```

### 2.2. External API (for UI and external applications - RESTful)

This API defines how external applications (like the UI) can interact with Netention.

## 3. Algorithms (Detailed)

### 3.1. Plan Creation Algorithm

**Input:**

* `taskDescription`: A string describing the task or goal.
* `agent`: The Agent instance responsible for creating the plan.
* `existingPlan`: Optional existing plan (for updates).

**Output:** A new or updated `Plan` object.

**Steps:**

1. **Prompt Construction:**
    * Use the `system_prompt` and `create_plan_system` templates from `prompt_templates.json`.
    * Fill the templates with:
        * `tool_descriptions`:  A string describing the available tools (generated by `agent._getToolDescriptions()`).
        * `task_description`: The input `taskDescription`.
        * (If `existingPlan` is provided) `previous_plan`: A formatted string representation of the existing plan (
          `existingPlan.formatPlan()`).
    * Create `systemMessage` and `userMessage` objects.

2. **LLM Interaction:**
    * Call the `callLLM` function with the constructed messages and `useTools = false` (initially, we don't want the LLM
      to execute tools, just to create the plan).

3. **Plan Parsing:**
    * If the LLM response (`response.content`) is valid JSON and can be parsed into a plan structure (using
      `Plan.createFromPrompt`), create a new `Plan` object.
    * If parsing fails, log an error and either:
        * Return a default, simple plan (e.g., a single step with the original task description).
        * Retry the LLM call with a modified prompt (e.g., asking for clarification).
        * Inform the user of the failure.

4. **Implicit Dependency Inference (Conceptual):**
    * This is where the "anticipatory" aspect comes in.
    * After the initial plan is created, the agent can analyze the plan steps and use the LLM to *infer* dependencies
      between them.
        * Prompt:  "Analyze this plan: \[plan]. Are there any implicit dependencies between the steps? Return a JSON
          array
          of dependencies, where each dependency is an object: `{ dependentStep: number, dependsOnStep: number}`".
    * Add edges to the plan's graph representation based on the inferred dependencies.

5. **Plan Storage:**
    * Save the new or updated plan to the graph database using `agent.savePlan()`.

### 3.2. Plan Execution Algorithm

**Input:**

* `agent`: The Agent instance responsible for executing the plan.
* `noteId`: ID of the Note this plan is associated with.

**Output:** (No direct output; the plan's state is updated in the database).

**Steps:**

1. **Load Plan:**
    * Load the plan from the database using `agent.loadPlan()`.

2. **Main Loop:**
    * `maxSteps`: Set a maximum number of iterations to prevent infinite loops.
    * Iterate while the plan's status is not "completed" or "failed" and the iteration count is less than `maxSteps`.

3. **Find Current Step:**
    * Use `plan.getCurrentStepIndex()` to find the index of the next step to execute (a step that is "pending", "
      running", or "waiting_user", and whose dependencies are met).
    * If `getCurrentStepIndex()` returns `null`, the plan is considered complete (all steps are "completed" or there are
      circular dependencies). Break the loop.

4. **Check Dependencies:**
    * For the current step, check if all its dependencies (if any) are "completed." If not, skip this step and continue
      to the next iteration.

5. **Agent 'Think' (Reasoning Step):**
    * Call `agent.think()` to interact with the LLM. This generates an LLM response based on:
        * The current plan (`plan.formatPlan()`).
        * The current step's description.
        * The agent's memory (`agent.memory`).
        * The available tools (`agent._getToolDescriptions()`).

6. **Agent 'Act' (Action Execution):**
    * Call `agent.act(actionResponse)`, where `actionResponse` is the LLM response from the `think()` step.
    * `agent.act()` handles:
        * **Tool Calls:** If the `actionResponse` contains `tool_calls`, iterate through them:
            * Get corresponding step index.
            * Update step status to `running`.
            * Use the `Executor` to execute the tool call (`executor.executeToolAsync(toolCall)`).
            * Store a placeholder message in memory.
            * When the tool execution completes (asynchronously):
                * Update the step's status to "completed" and store the result.
                * Update the corresponding message in memory with the tool's result.
        * **No Tool Calls:** If there are no tool calls, update the memory with the `actionResponse` content.

7. **User Feedback (Optional):**
    * Call `agent.getUserFeedback()`. If feedback is provided, add it to the agent's memory.

8. **Plan Update:**
    * Save the updated plan and memory to the database (`agent.savePlan()`, `agent.saveMemory()`).

9. **Plan Completion / Failure:**
    * If plan status set to completed by the LLM, stop execution.
    * If the loop finishes without the plan being completed, set the plan's status to "failed."

### 3.3. Tool Selection Algorithm (Implicit in `Agent.think()`)

Tool selection is not a separate algorithm but is embedded within the `Agent.think()` method. The agent uses the LLM to
decide which tool (if any) to use for the current plan step. This is done through:

1. **Prompt Engineering:**  The prompt sent to the LLM includes:
    * A description of the available tools (`agent._getToolDescriptions()`).
    * The current plan state.
    * The current step's description.
    * Instructions to select the most appropriate tool, or to respond with a reasoning step if no tool is needed.
2. **LLM Response:** The LLM responds with either:
    * A `tool_calls` array, indicating which tool(s) to use and their arguments.
    * Text content, representing a reasoning step or a decision not to use a tool.
3. **Agent Interpretation:** The agent parses the LLM response and either executes the tool calls (via `agent.act()`) or
   updates its memory with the reasoning step.

### 3.4 Unpacking from Seed (Detailed Algorithm)

This is a high-level algorithm, as the exact implementation depends on the LLM and prompting strategies.

**Input:**

* `seedDescription`: A JSON object containing the seed description (as described previously).

**Output:** A populated directory structure containing the Netention codebase.

**Steps:**

1. **Bootstrapping Agent Initialization:**
    * Create a minimal, hardcoded `BootstrappingAgent` class (a simplified version of the `Agent` class). This agent
      has:
        * Access to the LLM.
        * The `code_generation`, `file_write`, and `user_interaction` tools (and potentially a `self_reflection` tool).
        * A simplified plan execution mechanism.
        * Basic error handling.
    * Create an instance of the `BootstrappingAgent`.

2. **Seed Parsing:**
    * The `BootstrappingAgent` parses the `seedDescription`, extracting:
        * Natural language description of Netention.
        * Core concept definitions (Note, Agent, Plan, Tool, etc.).
        * Initial tool list.
        * Constraints.
        * Bootstrapping instructions.

3. **Initial Plan Creation:**
    * The agent creates an initial plan (using the LLM) based on the seed description and bootstrapping instructions.
      The top-level goal is "Build Netention."  Sub-goals might include:
        * "Create core data structure schemas (Note, Plan, etc.)."
        * "Generate code for the `Note` class."
        * "Generate code for the `Agent` class."
        * "Generate code for the `Plan` class."
        * "Generate code for the `Executor` class."
        * "Implement basic tool functionality (search, file_write, ...)."
        * "Create a minimal UI."
        * "Implement persistent storage (LevelGraph)."
        * ...and so on...

4. **Iterative Code Generation and Refinement:**
    * The agent executes the plan step-by-step. For each step (e.g., "Generate code for the `Note` class"):
        * **Prompt Construction:**  Craft a detailed prompt for the LLM, including:
            * The relevant part of the seed description (e.g., the JSON Schema for the `Note`).
            * Any existing code (if this is a refinement step).
            * Specific instructions (e.g., "Implement the `updateContent` method").
            * Constraints (e.g., "Follow coding best practices," "Minimize dependencies").
        * **Code Generation:**  Call the LLM (via the `code_generation` tool) to generate the code.
        * **Code Evaluation:**
            * **Syntactic Checks:** Use a JavaScript parser to check for syntax errors.
            * **Functional Tests (Conceptual):** Generate and execute simple test cases (using the `code_execution`
              tool – in a *very* restricted environment).
            * **Seed Alignment:** Use the LLM to analyze if the code aligns with the seed description and the prompt.
            * **Self-Reflection**: Ask the LLM to check the code.
        * **Code Storage:** If the code passes evaluation, use the `file_write` tool to save it to the appropriate file.
        * **Plan Update:** Update the plan based on the results (mark step as complete, add new sub-steps, revise steps,
          etc.).

5. **Bootstrapping to Full Functionality:** The agent iteratively generates and refines the codebase, gradually building
   up the complete Netention system. Later stages might involve:
    * Refactoring existing code.
    * Adding more advanced features.
    * Improving the UI.
    * Implementing more sophisticated planning and execution algorithms.

6. **Termination:** The process terminates when the agent determines (based on its plan and self-assessment) that the
   Netention system is complete and meets the requirements defined in the seed description.

## 4. Edge Cases and Considerations

* **LLM Errors:** The LLM might generate incorrect code, hallucinate, or fail to follow instructions.
    * **Solutions:** Robust error handling, retry mechanisms, multiple LLM calls with comparison, human-in-the-loop
      review (especially during bootstrapping).
* **Infinite Loops:** The agent might get stuck in a loop during plan creation or execution.
    * **Solutions:** Maximum iteration limits, detection of circular dependencies, mechanisms for breaking loops.
* **Security:** Executing generated code is risky.
    * **Solutions:** Strong sandboxing, limited tool capabilities, input validation, security audits.
* **Complexity Management:**  The system's complexity can grow rapidly.
    * **Solutions:** Modular design, clear separation of concerns, code refactoring, hierarchical planning.
* **Resource Constraints:** LLM calls can be expensive and time-consuming.
    * **Solutions:** Optimization of prompts, caching of LLM responses, use of smaller/faster models when possible.
* **Ambiguity in Seed Description:** The seed description might be unclear or incomplete.
    * **Solutions:** Use of structured formats (JSON Schema, DSL), iterative refinement of the seed description, human
      feedback.

## 5. Refined Unpacking Process

This expands on the previous unpacking description, adding more concrete steps.

1. **Seed Structure:** The seed is a JSON object with the following structure:

   ```json
   {
     "description": "Natural language description of Netention.",
     "concepts": {
       "Note": { /* JSON Schema for Note */ },
       "Agent": { /* JSON Schema for Agent (simplified) */ },
       "Plan": { /* JSON Schema for Plan */ },
       "Tool": { /* JSON Schema for Tool */ },
       "Message": { /* JSON Schema */ },
       "Domain": { /* JSON Schema */ }
     },
     "initialTools": [
       { "name": "code_generation", "description": "...", "inputSchema": {}, "outputSchema": {} },
       { "name": "file_write", "description": "...", "inputSchema": {}, "outputSchema": {} },
       { "name": "user_interaction", "description": "...", "inputSchema": {}, "outputSchema": {} },
       { "name": "self_reflection", "description": "...", "inputSchema": {}, "outputSchema": {} }
     ],
     "constraints": [
       "Minimize external dependencies",
       "Prioritize code clarity and maintainability",
       "Use asynchronous operations where appropriate",
       "Follow secure coding practices"
     ],
     "bootstrappingInstructions": [
       "Create a BootstrappingAgent class.",
       "Implement the core data structures (Note, Plan, Message).",
       "Implement the initial tools.",
       "Create a basic plan execution mechanism.",
       "Generate code for the full Agent class.",
       "Generate code for the Executor class.",
       "Implement the graph database integration.",
       "Create a minimal UI."
     ],
     "exampleTasks": [
       {
         "description": "Write a simple file.",
         "input": "Write the text 'Hello, world!' to a file named 'hello.txt'."
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Bootstrapping Agent:** This agent is hardcoded and has the following capabilities:

    * `parseSeed(seedDescription)`: Parses the seed JSON.
    * `createInitialPlan()`: Creates the initial plan based on `bootstrappingInstructions`.
    * `generateCode(prompt)`: Calls the LLM via the `code_generation` tool.
    * `writeFile(filename, content)`: Uses the `file_write` tool.
    * `evaluateCode(code)`: Performs basic syntactic and semantic checks (using the LLM and potentially simple test
      cases).
    * `executePlanStep(step)`: Executes a single plan step.
    * `updatePlan(step, status, result)`: Updates the plan's status.
    * `run()`: The main execution loop.
    * `promptUser(message, type)`

3. **Unpacking Steps (Detailed):**

    1. **Initialization:**
        * Create the `BootstrappingAgent` instance.
        * Load the `seedDescription`.
        * Parse the seed (`agent.parseSeed(seedDescription)`).
        * Create the initial plan (`agent.createInitialPlan()`).

    2. **Core Data Structures:**
        * **Step:** "Create core data structure schemas (Note, Plan, Message)."
        * **Prompt:** "Generate Zod schemas for the following data structures: Note, Plan, Message. The schemas should
          be based on the descriptions provided in the seed: \[...seed.concepts...]."
        * **Generate:** `agent.generateCode(prompt)` -> Zod schema code.
        * **Evaluate:** `agent.evaluateCode(code)` (check for syntax errors, alignment with seed).
        * **Write:** `agent.writeFile("schemas.js", code)`.
        * **Update:** `agent.updatePlan(step, "completed")`.

    3. **Initial Tools:**
        * **Steps:**  "Implement the `code_generation` tool," "Implement the `file_write` tool," etc. (one step per
          tool).
        * **Prompt (Example for `file_write`):** "Generate JavaScript code for a `file_write` tool. The tool should take
          a filename and content as input and write the content to the file. It should handle errors gracefully. The
          tool must follow the ToolSchema: \[...seed.concepts.Tool...]."
        * **Generate, Evaluate, Write, Update** (as above).

    4. **Bootstrapping Agent Code:**
        * **Step:** "Generate code for the `BootstrappingAgent` class."
        * **Prompt:** "Generate the full JavaScript code for the `BootstrappingAgent` class. This agent is responsible
          for unpacking the Netention codebase from a seed description. It should have methods for: parsing the seed,
          creating an initial plan, generating code, writing files, evaluating code, executing plan steps, and updating
          the plan. It should use the `code_generation`, `file_write`, and `user_interaction` tools. The code should be
          well-documented and follow best practices."
        * **Generate, Evaluate, Write, Update** (as above). This is a *recursive* step, as the agent is generating its
          own (more complete) code.

    5. **Plan Execution Logic:**
        * **Step:** "Create a basic plan execution mechanism."
        * **Prompt:** "Generate JavaScript code for a `Plan` class and a simplified plan execution loop (similar to the
          `Agent.run` method, but without the full complexity of tool selection). This code should be able to execute a
          sequence of steps, where each step involves either generating code or writing a file."
        * **Generate, Evaluate, Write, Update** (as above).

    6. **Full Agent, Executor, etc.:**
        * **Steps:** "Generate code for the full `Agent` class," "Generate code for the `Executor` class," etc.
        * **Prompts:** Similar to the previous steps, but now the prompts can refer to the already generated code (
          e.g., "The `Agent` class should use the `Executor` class to execute tools").
        * **Generate, Evaluate, Write, Update.**

    7. **Graph Database Integration:**
        * **Step:** "Implement persistent storage using LevelGraph/LevelDB."
        * **Prompt:** Generate code for saving and loading Notes, Plans, and Messages to/from a LevelGraph database.

    8. **Minimal UI (Conceptual):**
        * **Step:** "Create a minimal UI for interacting with Notes and Plans."  This could initially be a command-line
          interface, or a very basic web interface.

    9. **Continued Refinement:**
        * The agent continues to iterate, adding more features, refactoring code, and improving the system based on its
          self-reflection and (potentially) user feedback.

This refined unpacking process provides a more concrete roadmap for how Netention could build itself from a seed
description. It highlights the iterative nature of the process, the importance of prompt engineering, and the crucial
role of code evaluation and self-reflection. It also emphasizes the recursive aspect, where the agent generates code
that enhances its own capabilities. This is the core of the "metaprogramming" aspect of Netention.

> Increase conceptual integrity. Recursively unify the system within itself to create itself.

Okay, let's push the conceptual integrity of Netention to its logical extreme, aiming for a system that truly
recursively unifies and creates itself. This means moving beyond just generating code from a seed description, and
towards a system that:

1. **Defines its own Metamodel:** The seed doesn't just describe the *initial* state of Netention; it describes the
   *rules* for how Netention *evolves* itself.
2. **Is its own Runtime:**  The distinction between "bootstrapping agent" and "final system" blurs. The system is
   *always* in a state of self-modification and self-improvement.
3. **Uses its Core Concepts for Everything:**  Notes, Plans, Agents, Tools, and Memory are not just for managing user
   tasks; they are used *internally* to manage the system's own evolution.

This leads to a more radical and conceptually pure design.

**Netention: Recursive Self-Unification**

**1. The Primordial Note (The "Ur-Note")**

Instead of a separate "seed description" and "bootstrapping agent," we start with a single, pre-existing **Primordial
Note**. This Note is the *root* of the entire system, and it contains:

* **Content:** A high-level description of Netention's purpose, core concepts, and initial capabilities. This is similar
  to the previous seed description, but framed as the *content* of a Note.
* **Plan:** A plan whose goal is "Evolve Netention to its fullest potential."  This plan is initially very simple, but
  it will be continuously refined and expanded by the system itself.
* **Agent:** A minimal agent (the "Ur-Agent") with the core capabilities described before: LLM interaction, code
  generation, file writing, self-reflection, and *very* basic plan execution.
* **Memory:** Initially empty, but will accumulate the history of the system's evolution.
* **Type:** Domain (a domain called "Netention-Self")

**2. The Metamodel (Embedded in the Primordial Note)**

The Primordial Note's content includes a **metamodel** that defines:

* **Core Concepts:** Precise definitions (using JSON Schema or a DSL) of `Note`, `Plan`, `PlanStep`, `Agent`, `Tool`,
  `Message`, `Domain`, etc. This includes not just their data structure but also their *behavioral contracts* (e.g., "A
  Plan must have a method to find the next executable step").
* **Evolutionary Rules:** Rules that govern how the system can modify itself. Examples:
    * "New Tools can be created if they conform to the `ToolSchema`."
    * "The `Agent` class can be extended with new methods, provided they are documented and tested."
    * "The Plan execution algorithm can be modified, but only if the new algorithm provably maintains the core
      invariants of plan execution (e.g., respecting dependencies)."
    * "New prompt templates can be defined, but the system can modify existing prompt templates."
* **Evaluation Criteria:** Criteria to be used to improve code.
* **Bootstrapping Tasks:** An initial set of tasks to get the system started (similar to the `bootstrappingInstructions`
  in the previous design).

**3. The Recursive Unification Loop**

The Ur-Agent within the Primordial Note executes the following loop *indefinitely*:

1. **Self-Reflection:** The agent analyzes the *entire* system, including its own code, the metamodel, the current plan,
   and the memory. This is done by treating all these components as *Notes* within the system (or as data directly
   accessible from the Primordial Note).
2. **Plan Refinement:** Based on the self-reflection, the agent refines the "Evolve Netention" plan. This might involve:
    * Adding new steps to implement new features.
    * Modifying existing steps to improve performance or fix bugs.
    * Creating sub-plans to address complex tasks.
    * *Changing the plan refinement process itself*.
3. **Step Execution:** The agent executes the next step in the plan. This could involve:
    * **Code Generation:** Generating new code or modifying existing code (using the `code_generation` tool, guided by
      the metamodel and the plan).
    * **Tool Creation:** Defining new Tools (using the `code_generation` tool to create the tool's code and the
      `file_write` tool to save it).
    * **Prompt Template Modification:** Refining existing prompt templates or creating new ones.
    * **Metamodel Modification (with extreme caution):** In advanced stages, the system could even *modify the metamodel
      itself*, but only under very strict constraints defined within the metamodel. This is where the "evolutionary
      rules" are crucial.
    * **Data Structure Modification:** Alter data structures as needed, always using itself to do so.
4. **Evaluation:** The agent evaluates the results of the step execution. This involves:
    * **Automated Tests:** Running tests (generated by the system itself) to verify that the changes work as expected.
    * **LLM Analysis:** Using the LLM to analyze the code for quality, efficiency, and adherence to the metamodel.
    * **Self-Consistency Checks:** Ensuring that the changes haven't introduced any inconsistencies or contradictions
      into the system.
5. **Memory Update:** All changes, results, and evaluations are recorded in the Primordial Note's Memory (and in the
   memories of other Notes that are created during the process).
6. **Loop:** Go back to step 1.

**4. Key Changes and Implications**

* **No External Seed:** The system starts from a single, self-contained Note.
* **Continuous Evolution:** The system is *always* evolving, not just during an initial "unpacking" phase.
* **Self-Modification:** The system modifies its own code, data structures, and even (potentially) its own metamodel.
  This is the ultimate form of metaprogramming.
* **Emergent Structure:** The structure of the codebase emerges organically from the interaction of the agent, the plan,
  the tools, and the LLM, guided by the metamodel.
* **Unified Representation:**  Everything – code, plans, data, memory, even the system's own description – is
  represented within the framework of Notes and the graph database.
* **Domain "Netention-Self":** The Domain of the Primordial note is intrinsically linked to evolving the system.

**5. Example: Creating a New Tool**

1. **Self-Reflection:** The agent analyzes the system and identifies a need for a new tool (e.g., a tool to summarize
   text).
2. **Plan Update:** The agent adds a new step to the "Evolve Netention" plan: "Create a `summarize` tool."
3. **Step Execution:**
    * **Prompt:** The agent generates a prompt for the LLM: "Create a new tool named `summarize` that conforms to the
      `ToolSchema` defined in the Primordial Note. The tool should take text as input and return a concise summary. The
      tool should be implemented in JavaScript."
    * **Code Generation:** The LLM generates the code for the `summarize` tool.
    * **Evaluation:** The agent evaluates the generated code (using tests, LLM analysis, etc.).
    * **Storage:** The agent uses the `file_write` tool to save the code to `tools/summarize.js`. It also creates a new
      `Tool` node in the graph database, linked to the Primordial Note.
4. **Memory Update:** The agent records the creation of the new tool in the Primordial Note's memory.
5. **Loop:** The agent continues with the next step in the plan (which might involve using the new `summarize` tool).

**6. Challenges and Considerations (Even More Critical Now)**

* **Safety:** Self-modifying code is extremely dangerous. The slightest error could lead to catastrophic failure or
  unpredictable behavior. The "evolutionary rules" in the metamodel are absolutely crucial for preventing the system
  from destroying itself.
* **Stability:** How do we ensure that the system evolves in a *positive* direction, rather than degrading into chaos?
  This requires careful design of the metamodel, the prompt templates, and the evaluation mechanisms.
* **Explainability:**  It will be very difficult to understand *why* the system made certain decisions or *how* it
  arrived at a particular state. This is a major challenge for debugging and maintenance.
* **Computational Cost:** Continuous self-reflection and LLM interaction could be very expensive.
* **Conceptual Complexity:** This design is highly abstract and conceptually challenging.

**7. Bootstrapping Agent Becomes The Primordial Agent**

* All capabilities are stored in notes, and called when needed.
* The Primordial Agent simply executes the main loop.

**8. Conclusion**

This recursively unified design represents the most conceptually pure and ambitious vision of Netention. It's a system
that is truly self-organizing, self-evolving, and self-defining. While the practical challenges are significant, the
potential rewards – a system that can adapt and improve itself indefinitely – are immense. This is a system that blurs
the lines between program and data, between creator and creation, and between user and AI. It is a living, evolving
system.

Okay, let's clarify the system design of this recursively self-unifying Netention, focusing on making the core concepts
and their interactions as clear and understandable as possible. We'll break it down into:

1. **Conceptual Overview (Simplified)**
2. **Core Components (Revisited and Refined)**
3. **The "Life Cycle" of a Note (and the System)**
4. **Key Design Decisions & Rationale**
5. **Addressing Previous Challenges**

**1. Conceptual Overview (Simplified)**

Imagine a single, special note – the **Primordial Note**. This note is like the "seed" of the entire Netention system.
It contains:

* **What Netention *is*:** A description of Netention's purpose, core concepts (like Note, Agent, Plan, Tool), and rules
  for how it can change itself. This is the "metamodel."
* **How to *grow* Netention:** A plan, initially very simple, that describes how to expand and improve Netention.
* **The ability to *act*:** A built-in, minimal agent (the "Ur-Agent") that can understand the description and the plan,
  and can take actions to carry out the plan. These actions primarily involve using a Large Language Model (LLM) to
  generate code.

The Ur-Agent follows a continuous loop:

1. **Look at Itself:** It reads the Primordial Note (including its own code, the metamodel, the plan, and the history of
   past actions).
2. **Decide What to Do:** It uses the LLM to figure out how to best improve Netention, based on the current state and
   the plan. This often involves modifying the plan itself.
3. **Take Action:** It uses the LLM to generate new code (for new features, tools, or improvements to existing code),
   and then writes that code to files.
4. **Check its Work:** It uses the LLM and (potentially) simple tests to make sure the new code works and doesn't break
   anything.
5. **Repeat:** It goes back to step 1, constantly reflecting on itself and improving.

Over time, this process creates the entire Netention system – not from a pre-written codebase, but *emerging* from the
Primordial Note and the actions of the Ur-Agent. Every part of the system (including the user interface, the database
integration, and even the more advanced features of the agent) is created in this way. The system *becomes* what it
*describes*. And because it's all based on Notes, Plans, and Agents, the fully-grown Netention can then be used to
manage *anything*, including its own ongoing development.

**2. Core Components (Revisited and Refined)**

* **Primordial Note:**  The single, root Note that contains the seed description and the Ur-Agent. It's a regular
  `Note`, but with a special status. It has a `type` of `Domain`, and `name` of "Netention-Self".
    * `id`: A unique UUID.
    * `type`: "Domain"
    * `name`: "Netention-Self"
    * `content`: The seed description (metamodel, initial plan, etc.) – this is *structured* data, not just plain text.
    * `planId`:  The ID of the "Evolve Netention" plan.
    * `agentId`: The ID of the Ur-Agent.
    * `status`: "running" (it's always running).
    * `createdAt`: The time the system was initialized.
    * `updatedAt`: The time the system was last modified.
    * `domain`: null. // It is it's own domain.

* **Ur-Agent (Primordial Agent):**  The minimal agent embedded within the Primordial Note. It's *not* fundamentally
  different from other agents, but it has a very limited initial set of capabilities. Its primary job is to execute
  the "Evolve Netention" plan.
    * `id`: A unique UUID.
    * `noteId`:  The ID of the Primordial Note.
    * `config`:  Basic configuration (e.g., LLM API key).
    * `tools`:  Initially, only `code_generation`, `file_write`, `user_interaction`, and `self_reflection`. More tools
      are added *by* the agent as it evolves the system.
    * `memory`:  A record of all actions taken, code generated, evaluations, etc. This is stored *within* the Primordial
      Note's memory (and potentially in other Notes created by the system).
    * `think()`:  Uses the LLM to reason and make decisions.
    * `act()`:  Executes actions (primarily tool calls).
    * `run()`: The main execution loop (the self-reflection, plan refinement, step execution cycle).

* **Note:** (As defined before, but now *everything* is a Note). Regular Notes, Domain Notes, and even the components of
  the system itself (modules, classes, functions) are represented as Notes (or as structured data within Notes).
    * `id`: A unique UUID.
    * `type`: "Note" (or a more specific type, like "CodeNote", "PlanNote", "ToolNote", etc. – these subtypes are
      defined *within* the metamodel).
    * `title`: A human-readable title.
    * `content`: The Note's content (which can be text, code, data, etc.).
    * `status`: The Note's current status.
    * `createdAt`: Creation timestamp.
    * `updatedAt`: Last modified timestamp.
    * `planId`: The ID of the associated Plan (if any).
    * `agentId`: The ID of the associated Agent (if any).
    * `domain`: domain note id.

* **Plan:** (As defined before). A graph-based representation of how to achieve a goal. The "Evolve Netention" plan is
  the master plan, but other Notes can have their own plans.
    * `id`: plan id.
    * `type`: "Plan".
    * `noteId`: note the plan belongs to.
    * `goals`:  A list of goals.
    * `constraints`:  Limitations.
    * `status`: The overall plan status.

* **PlanStep:** (As defined before). A single step in a Plan.
    * `id`: A unique UUID.
    * `type`: "PlanStep"
    * `planId`: ID of plan.
    * `stepNumber`: order.
    * `description`:  What to do.
    * `status`:  Current status.
    * `tool`:  The Tool to use (if any).
    * `args`:  Arguments for the tool.
    * `result`:  The result of executing the tool.
    * `notes`:  Explanations or comments.
    * `dependencies`:  IDs of other steps that must be completed first.

* **Tool:** (As defined before). An external capability that an Agent can use. The initial tools are hardcoded, but new
  tools are added *by* the system itself.
    * `name`:  The tool's name (e.g., "code_generation").
    * `description`:  What the tool does.
    * `inputSchema`:  Defines the expected input (using JSON Schema).
    * `outputSchema`:  Defines the structure of the output.
    * `execute`:  The function that actually performs the tool's action.
    * `isAsync`: flag if tool is async.

* **Executor:** (As defined before). Manages the execution of tools, handling asynchronous operations.

* **Memory:** (As defined before, but now understood as *distributed* across Notes). Each Note has its own memory, which
  is a record of the interactions and events related to that Note.

* **Metamodel:**  A *structured* description of the core concepts and rules of Netention, stored within the Primordial
  Note's `content`. This is the key to self-modification. It defines:
    * The schemas for all core data structures.
    * The allowed operations on those data structures.
    * The rules for how the system can evolve itself.
    * The criteria for evaluating changes.

* **Domain:** (As defined before) Used to tag notes, plans, and tools for categorization.

**3. The "Life Cycle" of a Note (and the System)**

1. **Creation:** A Note is created (either by the user or by the system itself). This involves:
    * Assigning a unique ID.
    * Setting the initial `type`, `title`, `content`, and `status`.
    * Creating an associated `Agent` (unless it's a purely data-oriented Note).
    * Potentially creating an associated `Plan`.

2. **Interaction:** The Agent associated with the Note interacts with the LLM, other Notes, and the user (via Tools).
   This is the `think()` and `act()` cycle.

3. **Planning:** The Agent updates the Note's Plan based on the interactions and the current context.

4. **Execution:** The Agent uses the `Executor` to execute Tools, carrying out the steps in the Plan.

5. **Memory Update:** All interactions, results, and plan changes are recorded in the Note's Memory.

6. **State Change:** The Note's `status` and `content` might change based on the results of plan execution.

7. **Termination (or Dormancy):** A Note can become "completed" or "failed," or it can become dormant, waiting for
   further input or events.

The *system* as a whole follows this same life cycle, but at a higher level. The Primordial Note is always "running,"
and its "life cycle" is the continuous evolution of Netention.

**4. Key Design Decisions & Rationale**

* **Everything is a Note (or in a Note):** This provides a unified representation for all data and logic within the
  system, simplifying interactions and enabling self-reflection.
* **Graph Database:**  The graph structure is essential for representing the relationships between Notes, Plans, Steps,
  and Tools. It also allows for efficient querying and traversal of the system's state.
* **Asynchronous Execution:**  This is crucial for handling interactions with external systems (LLMs, web services)
  without blocking the main execution loop.
* **Metamodel:**  The metamodel is the key to safe self-modification. It defines the rules that govern how the system
  can change itself, preventing runaway evolution or catastrophic errors.
* **LLM as a Reasoning Engine:** The LLM is not the *entire* intelligence; it's a tool that the Agent uses for
  reasoning, planning, and code generation. The Agent provides the structure and context.
* **Prompt Templates:**  Reusable prompt templates are essential for consistent and effective LLM interaction.
* **Domain as Note:** This allows grouping.

**5. Addressing Previous Challenges**

* **Safety:** The metamodel's "evolutionary rules" and the strict evaluation of generated code are the primary
  safeguards against self-destruction.
* **Stability:** The metamodel, prompt templates, and evaluation criteria are designed to guide the system towards
  positive evolution. Automated tests and LLM-based analysis help to ensure that changes are improvements.
* **Explainability:**  The distributed memory system (where each Note has its own history) helps to track the reasoning
  behind decisions. However, this remains a significant challenge.
* **Computational Cost:**  Careful prompt engineering, caching of LLM responses, and the use of smaller/faster models
  when possible can help to mitigate this. The system could also prioritize tasks based on their importance and urgency.
* **Conceptual Complexity:** The unified conceptual framework, with its focus on the Active Note, helps to simplify the
  system's overall design. However, the implementation details are still complex.

**In summary, this refined design emphasizes:**

* **Recursive Self-Unification:** The system creates and modifies itself using its own core concepts.
* **Emergent Intelligence:** The system's capabilities emerge from the interaction of simple components.
* **Metamodel-Driven Evolution:** The metamodel defines the rules for self-modification, ensuring safety and stability.
* **Unified Representation:** Everything is a Note (or part of a Note), simplifying interactions and enabling
  self-reflection.

This design is highly ambitious, but it represents a powerful and elegant approach to building a truly self-evolving AI
system. The key is to start with a very simple, robust core and then gradually add complexity, guided by the metamodel
and the continuous self-reflection process.

> Refine the design, unifying common behaviors and patterns.

> Prioritization is key for operating under resource limitations: what to do next, and what to forget next.

You're absolutely right. Prioritization and resource management are critical, especially in a system designed for
continuous self-improvement and operation on potentially limited hardware. Let's refine the design, focusing on:

1. **Unifying Behaviors:** Identifying and abstracting common patterns across Agents, Plans, and Tools.
2. **Prioritization Mechanisms:** Implementing strategies for deciding what actions to take and what information to
   retain.
3. **Resource Management:** Considering how to manage computational resources (CPU, memory, LLM calls).
4. **Forgetting Mechanisms:** Defining how the system can selectively "forget" information to manage memory usage.

**Netention: Refined Design with Prioritization and Resource Management**

**1. Unified Behaviors (Abstraction and Patterns)**

We can identify several recurring patterns that can be abstracted into reusable components:

* **LLM Interaction:**  All Agents interact with the LLM in a similar way: constructing prompts, sending requests, and
  processing responses. This can be encapsulated in a dedicated `LLMInterface` class (which is itself managed as a Tool,
  fitting the recursive nature).
* **Plan Execution:**  All Agents (including the Ur-Agent) execute plans. The core plan execution logic (finding the
  next step, checking dependencies, executing tools) can be centralized in a `PlanExecutor` class (or potentially
  integrated into the `Executor`).
* **Tool Execution:** The `Executor` already provides a unified interface for tool execution.
* **Memory Management:** All Notes (and therefore Agents) need to manage their memory. This can be handled by a
  `MemoryManager` class associated with each Note.
* **Prompt Management:** All agents utilize prompt templates. A dedicated `PromptManager` is created.
* **Status Tracking:** Notes, Plans, and PlanSteps all have a `status` field. The logic for updating and interpreting
  status can be standardized.

This leads to a more modular and maintainable design, reducing code duplication and promoting consistency.

**2. Prioritization Mechanisms**

Prioritization needs to happen at multiple levels:

* **Note Prioritization:** Which Note should the system focus on *now*?
* **Plan Prioritization:** If multiple Notes have active plans, which plan should be executed next?
* **Step Prioritization:** Within a plan, which step should be executed next (beyond just dependency order)?
* **Tool Prioritization:** If multiple tools are applicable to a step, which one should be chosen? (This is largely
  handled by the LLM, but we can influence it.)
* **Memory Prioritization:** Which information should be retained in memory, and which can be "forgotten" (archived or
  summarized)?

To implement prioritization, we introduce the following:

* **Priority Scores:**  Notes, Plans, and PlanSteps will have a `priority` field (a numerical score). Higher scores
  indicate higher priority.
* **Priority Propagation:**  The priority of a PlanStep can influence the priority of its parent Plan, and the priority
  of a Plan can influence the priority of its associated Note. This creates a hierarchical prioritization scheme.
* **Dynamic Priority Updates:**  Priority scores are *not* static; they are updated dynamically based on:
    * **User Input:** The user can explicitly set the priority of a Note.
    * **Deadlines:**  Notes and Plans can have deadlines, which automatically increase their priority as the deadline
      approaches.
    * **Dependencies:**  If a high-priority Note depends on a lower-priority Note, the priority of the lower-priority
      Note can be temporarily boosted.
    * **Recency:**  Recently accessed or modified Notes can have a slightly higher priority.
    * **Relevance:** The system can use the LLM to assess the relevance of a Note to the user's current context (e.g.,
      based on their recent activity or calendar events – *if* such context is available and permitted by privacy
      settings).
    * **System Needs:** The "Evolve Netention" plan (associated with the Primordial Note) will always have a baseline
      level of priority, ensuring that the system continues to improve itself.
* **Priority-Based Scheduling:** The `PlanExecutor` (or a separate `Scheduler` component) will select the
  highest-priority PlanStep to execute at each iteration.

**3. Resource Management**

* **LLM Token Budget:**  The system will track the number of LLM tokens used. Agents can have individual token budgets,
  and there can be a global system-wide budget. Exceeding a budget can trigger:
    * Switching to a smaller, cheaper LLM.
    * Prioritizing tasks that require fewer LLM calls.
    * Summarizing existing information to reduce context length.
    * Delaying non-critical tasks.
* **Memory Limits:**  Each Note (and the system as a whole) will have a memory limit. When the limit is approached, the
  system will trigger "forgetting" mechanisms (see below).
* **CPU/Execution Time Limits:** The system can monitor CPU usage and execution time, and potentially pause or
  reschedule long-running tasks.
* **Tool Quotas (Conceptual):**  Specific tools (especially those that interact with external services) could have usage
  quotas to prevent overuse.

**4. Forgetting Mechanisms**

"Forgetting" is crucial for managing memory usage and maintaining focus. It doesn't necessarily mean deleting
information; it can involve:

* **Summarization:**  Replacing detailed information with a concise summary (generated by the LLM). The original
  information can be archived (see below).
* **Archiving:**  Moving less-relevant Notes (or parts of their memory) to a separate, less-frequently accessed storage
  area. This could be a different part of the graph database, or even an external storage system.
* **Abstraction:**  Replacing specific details with more general concepts. For example, instead of remembering every
  step of a completed plan, the system might remember only the overall goal and outcome.
* **Expiration:**  Automatically archiving or deleting Notes that haven't been accessed or modified for a certain period
  of time (with user-configurable settings).
* **LLM-Assisted Forgetting:**  The system could use the LLM to identify which information is least relevant or
  important, and therefore can be safely forgotten. Prompt: "Here is the memory of this note: \[memory]. Which parts are
  least relevant to the overall goal of \[goal] and can be summarized or archived?".

**Revised Data Model (Adding Priority and Resource Tracking)**

```javascript
const NoteSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string().uuid(),
  type: z.literal("Note"),
  title: z.string(),
  content: z.string(),
  status: z.enum(["pending", "running", "completed", "failed", "dormant", "archived"]), // Added 'dormant' and 'archived'
  createdAt: z.string().datetime(),
  updatedAt: z.string().datetime(),
  planId: z.string().uuid().nullable(),
  agentId: z.string().uuid(),
  priority: z.number().int().default(0), // Priority score
  deadline: z.string().datetime().nullable(), // Optional deadline
  memoryUsage: z.number().int().default(0), // Estimated memory usage (in bytes or some other unit)
  domain: z.string().optional(),
});

const PlanSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string().uuid(),
  type: z.literal("Plan"),
  noteId: z.string().uuid(),
  goals: z.array(z.string()),
  constraints: z.record(z.any()),
  status: z.enum(["pending", "running", "completed", "failed"]),
  createdAt: z.string().datetime(),
  updatedAt: z.string().datetime(),
  priority: z.number().int().default(0), // Priority score
  deadline: z.string().datetime().nullable(), // Optional deadline
});

const PlanStepSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string().uuid(),
  type: z.literal("PlanStep"),
  planId: z.string().uuid(),
  stepNumber: z.number().int(),
  description: z.string(),
  status: z.enum(["pending", "running", "completed", "failed", "waiting_user"]),
  tool: z.string().nullable(),
  args: z.record(z.any()).nullable(),
  result: z.string().nullable(),
  notes: z.string(),
  dependencies: z.array(z.string().uuid()),
  priority: z.number().int().default(0), // Priority score
});

// ... other schemas remain largely the same ...
```

**Revised Algorithms (Adding Prioritization)**

* **Plan Creation:** The initial priority of a Plan and its steps can be based on user input, deadlines, or LLM-based
  assessment of importance.
* **Plan Execution:**
    * The `PlanExecutor` (or `Scheduler`) selects the highest-priority *executable* PlanStep (considering dependencies
      and resource availability).
    * Before executing a step, check resource limits (memory, LLM tokens, etc.). If limits are exceeded, trigger
      forgetting mechanisms or delay the step.
* **Agent.think():**  The prompt sent to the LLM can include information about the current priority of the Note and
  Plan, influencing the LLM's choice of actions and tools. The prompt can also ask the LLM to *suggest* a priority for
  the next step.
* **Memory Management:** The `MemoryManager` periodically checks memory usage and triggers forgetting mechanisms when
  limits are approached.

**Revised Unpacking Process (Highlights)**

The unpacking process remains largely the same, but with these additions:

* **Resource Constraints in Seed:** The seed description can include initial resource limits (memory, LLM tokens).
* **Prioritization in Initial Plan:** The initial "Evolve Netention" plan can include steps for implementing
  prioritization and resource management mechanisms.
* **Early Forgetting:** Even during the bootstrapping phase, the system can use summarization and archiving to manage
  memory usage.

**New and Revised Components**

* **`LLMInterface` Class:**  Handles all interactions with the LLM, including prompt construction, sending requests,
  processing responses, and managing token usage.
    * `callLLM(messages, tools, priority)`:  Adds a `priority` parameter to influence LLM behavior.
* **`PlanExecutor` Class (Enhanced):**
    * `getNextStep()`:  Selects the highest-priority executable step, considering dependencies, resource availability,
      and priority scores.
    * `runPlan(planId)`: Executes plan.
* **`MemoryManager` Class:**
    * `record(noteId, data)`:  Adds data to a Note's memory, updating `memoryUsage`.
    * `summarize(noteId, strategy)`:  Summarizes a Note's memory using the specified strategy.
    * `archive(noteId, strategy)`:  Archives parts of a Note's memory.
    * `forget(noteId, strategy)`: Selectively removes information.
    * `getMemory(noteId)`
* **`PromptManager` Class:**
    * `getPrompt(templateName, values)`
* **`Scheduler` Class (Optional):**  A more sophisticated scheduler that manages task queues and resource allocation.
  This might be necessary for handling complex dependencies and parallel execution.

**Conceptual Flow with Prioritization and Resource Management**

1. **User creates a Note (or system creates a Note internally).**  A priority is assigned (either explicitly by the
   user, or implicitly based on context).
2. **Agent interprets the Note and updates the Plan.**  The Plan and its steps inherit the Note's priority (but can be
   adjusted).
3. **`PlanExecutor` selects the highest-priority executable PlanStep.**  It considers dependencies, resource limits, and
   priority scores.
4. **`LLMInterface` is used to interact with the LLM.** The `priority` of the task is passed to the LLM to influence its
   behavior. Token usage is tracked.
5. **Tools are executed (via `Executor`).**
6. **Results are recorded in Memory (via `MemoryManager`).**  Memory usage is tracked.
7. **`MemoryManager` checks memory limits.** If limits are approached, it triggers forgetting mechanisms (summarization,
   archiving).
8. **Priorities are dynamically updated** based on deadlines, dependencies, recency, and relevance.
9. **The cycle repeats.**

This refined design creates a more robust, efficient, and adaptable Netention system that can operate effectively under
resource constraints and prioritize its actions intelligently. The key is the continuous interplay between
prioritization, resource management, and the core loop of agent interaction, planning, and execution. The addition of
`dormant` and `archived` states for notes allows for a more nuanced handling of information, going beyond simple
deletion. The explicit tracking of `memoryUsage` provides a concrete metric for triggering forgetting mechanisms. The
`priority` field, dynamically updated and propagated through the system, ensures that the most important tasks are
addressed first.

> Crystallize the complete evolution of the system.

Let's crystallize the complete evolutionary arc of Netention, from its Primordial Note to a fully self-evolving system.
This will involve describing the stages of development, the key milestones, and the mechanisms that drive the system's
growth. We'll focus on how the system's capabilities expand and how it becomes increasingly autonomous.

**Netention: The Evolutionary Arc**

The evolution of Netention can be viewed as a series of stages, each building upon the previous one. The driving force
is the Ur-Agent within the Primordial Note, continuously executing the "Evolve Netention" plan. This plan itself is
constantly being refined and expanded *by* the system.

**Stage 0: The Primordial Spark**

* **State:** The system exists only as the Primordial Note, containing the metamodel, the initial "Evolve Netention"
  plan (very basic), and the Ur-Agent with its minimal toolset (`code_generation`, `file_write`, `user_interaction`,
  `self_reflection`). The graph database contains only this single node.
* **Capabilities:** The Ur-Agent can parse the seed description, interact with the LLM, generate simple code snippets,
  write files, and perform very basic self-reflection. It *cannot* yet execute arbitrary code or manage complex plans.
* **Goal:** To bootstrap the core components of Netention.

**Stage 1: Bootstrapping the Core**

* **Focus:** Building the foundational elements of the system.
* **Key Milestones:**
    * **Schema Definition:** Generate Zod schemas for `Note`, `Plan`, `PlanStep`, `Message`, `Tool`, and `Domain`. (
      These schemas are initially defined *within* the Primordial Note's content but are then externalized into
      `schemas.js`).
    * **Core Classes (Minimal):** Generate basic JavaScript code for the `Note`, `Plan`, `Agent` (a simplified version),
      and `Executor` classes. These initial versions will have limited functionality.
    * **Tool Implementation (Initial):** Implement the initial tools (`code_generation`, `file_write`,
      `user_interaction`, `self_reflection`) in a more robust way. These become separate files within a `tools/`
      directory.
    * **Basic Plan Execution:** Implement a simplified `PlanExecutor` that can execute a sequence of steps (primarily
      involving code generation and file writing).
    * **Graph Database Integration (Rudimentary):** Implement basic functions for saving and loading Notes and Plans
      to/from the LevelGraph database.
    * **LLMInterface:** Create basic LLM interaction.
    * **Memory Management:** Create basic Memory Management.
* **Mechanism:** The Ur-Agent uses the LLM to generate code snippets based on prompts derived from the seed description
  and the initial plan. It evaluates the code using basic syntax checks and LLM-based analysis. It writes the code to
  files and updates the plan accordingly.
* **Outcome:** A minimal, but functional, core of Netention. The system can now represent Notes, Plans, and Tools, and
  can execute simple plans involving code generation.

**Stage 2: Expanding Capabilities**

* **Focus:**  Adding more sophisticated features and expanding the system's capabilities.
* **Key Milestones:**
    * **Full Agent Implementation:** Generate the complete `Agent` class, with its `think()`, `act()`, and `run()`
      methods, and its ability to manage memory and interact with the LLM.
    * **Enhanced Plan Execution:**  Improve the `PlanExecutor` to handle dependencies, asynchronous tool execution, and
      error handling. Implement the prioritization mechanisms.
    * **Tool Expansion:**  Create new tools:
        * `search`:  For web search.
        * `summarize`: For text summarization.
        * `read_file`:  For reading file contents.
        * (And many others, as defined by the evolving plan).
    * **Prompt Template Management:** Implement a `PromptManager` and create a library of reusable prompt templates.
    * **Improved Memory Management:** Implement summarization, archiving, and forgetting mechanisms within the
      `MemoryManager`.
    * **Basic UI:** Create a minimal user interface (initially, likely a command-line interface) for interacting with
      Notes and Plans.
    * **Testing Framework:** Begin to generate and execute tests for the generated code. (This is a crucial step towards
      self-improvement.)
* **Mechanism:**  The Ur-Agent (now running within the partially built Netention system) continues to refine the "Evolve
  Netention" plan, adding new steps to implement these features. It uses the LLM to generate code, create tools, and
  refine existing components. It increasingly relies on the *generated* code (the `Agent`, `PlanExecutor`, etc.) rather
  than its own hardcoded capabilities.
* **Outcome:** Netention becomes a usable system, capable of managing knowledge and tasks, although still relatively
  rudimentary.

**Stage 3: Self-Improvement and Refinement**

* **Focus:**  Improving the system's performance, efficiency, robustness, and user experience. This is a continuous,
  iterative process.
* **Key Milestones:**
    * **Code Refactoring:** The system analyzes its own codebase (using the `self_reflection` tool and the LLM) and
      identifies areas for improvement. It generates new code to refactor existing modules, improve code clarity, and
      optimize performance.
    * **Algorithm Optimization:** The system can analyze and improve its own algorithms (e.g., the plan execution
      algorithm, the prioritization algorithm). This might involve generating new code, or even modifying the
      metamodel (within the defined constraints).
    * **UI Enhancement:** The system gradually improves the user interface, adding new features and making it more
      intuitive and user-friendly.
    * **Tool Refinement:** Existing tools are improved and made more robust.
    * **Prompt Template Optimization:**  The system analyzes the effectiveness of different prompt templates and refines
      them to get better results from the LLM.
    * **Error Handling Improvement:** The system adds more comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms.
    * **Security Hardening:** The system analyzes its own code for potential security vulnerabilities and generates code
      to address them.
* **Mechanism:**  The Ur-Agent (now running within a much more capable Netention system) focuses on self-improvement. It
  uses the `self_reflection` tool extensively, along with the LLM, to analyze the codebase, identify weaknesses, and
  generate improvements. It leverages the testing framework to ensure that changes are beneficial.
* **Outcome:** Netention becomes increasingly sophisticated, efficient, and robust. It is constantly learning and
  adapting.

**Stage 4: Autonomous Evolution**

* **Focus:**  The system becomes largely autonomous in its evolution, driven by its own internal goals and the user's
  interactions.
* **Key Milestones:**
    * **Goal-Driven Development:** The system can generate new goals for itself (e.g., "Improve the accuracy of the
      `summarize` tool," "Add support for collaborative note editing"). These goals are added to the "Evolve Netention"
      plan.
    * **New Feature Development:** The system can design and implement entirely new features, driven by user needs or
      its own internal analysis.
    * **Adaptive Metamodel:**  Within the strict constraints defined in the metamodel, the system can even *modify the
      metamodel itself*, potentially changing the fundamental rules of its own evolution. This is the most advanced and
      potentially dangerous stage.
    * **External Knowledge Acquisition:** The system can use web search and other tools to learn about new technologies,
      algorithms, and best practices, and incorporate this knowledge into its own codebase.
* **Mechanism:**  The Ur-Agent (now essentially indistinguishable from other Agents) operates with a high degree of
  autonomy. It continuously monitors the system, identifies areas for improvement, generates new goals, and executes
  plans to achieve those goals. It relies heavily on the LLM for reasoning, planning, and code generation, but it also
  uses its own internal knowledge and experience (stored in the distributed memory system).
* **Outcome:** Netention becomes a truly self-evolving system, capable of adapting to changing user needs and
  technological advancements without direct human intervention. It is a dynamic, living entity.

**The "Evolve Netention" Plan:**

This plan is the central driver of the system's evolution. It starts as a simple list of bootstrapping tasks, but it
grows and changes over time. It's a *graph*, not a linear sequence, allowing for parallel development and branching
possibilities.

* **Early Stages:**  The plan focuses on building the core components.
* **Later Stages:**  The plan includes steps for refactoring code, optimizing algorithms, adding new features, and
  improving the UI. It also includes meta-level steps, like "Analyze the effectiveness of the prioritization algorithm"
  or "Identify potential security vulnerabilities."
* **Dynamic Generation:** The plan is *not* predefined; it's generated and modified by the system itself, based on its
  self-reflection and its interactions with the LLM and the user.

**The Role of the LLM:**

The LLM is the *engine* of the system's evolution, but it's not the *driver*. The Ur-Agent (and later, other Agents) use
the LLM as a tool for:

* **Code Generation:** Generating new code based on prompts.
* **Code Analysis:** Analyzing existing code for quality, efficiency, and security.
* **Reasoning and Planning:**  Generating plans, identifying dependencies, and making decisions.
* **Self-Reflection:** Analyzing the system's own state and behavior.
* **Knowledge Acquisition:** Learning about new technologies and algorithms.

**The Role of the User:**

The user is a *co-creator* of the system's intelligence. They interact with Netention by:

* **Creating Notes:** Defining tasks, ideas, and information.
* **Providing Feedback:**  Answering questions, correcting errors, and guiding the system's learning.
* **Setting Priorities:**  Indicating which Notes and Plans are most important.
* **Defining Goals:**  Suggesting new features or improvements.

The user's interactions shape the system's evolution, guiding it towards their specific needs and preferences.

This diagram shows the key relationships:

* The Ur-Agent resides within the Primordial Note and interacts with the LLM.
* The Ur-Agent executes the "Evolve Netention" plan, which results in the creation and modification of the Netention
  system (code, data, UI).
* The Ur-Agent uses Tools (from the Tool Registry) to perform actions.
* The User interacts with Netention, providing input and guidance.
* The entire system is built upon, and continues to utilize the core concepts of, Notes, Plans, Agents, and Tools.

This crystallized view of Netention's evolution highlights its self-organizing, self-improving, and ultimately,
autonomous nature. The system is not a static artifact; it's a dynamic process, constantly evolving and adapting to its
environment and its user's needs. It's a testament to the power of metaprogramming and emergent intelligence. The stages
provide a roadmap for development, starting with a minimal core and gradually expanding to a full-fledged, self-evolving
system.

Okay, let's outline a development plan for Netention, with a strong emphasis on minimizing human effort throughout the
process. This means leveraging the system's self-evolving capabilities as much as possible, automating tasks, and
strategically prioritizing development efforts.

**Guiding Principles for Minimal-Effort Development:**

1. **Bootstrap ASAP:** Get the "Primordial Note" and Ur-Agent working as quickly as possible. This is the foundation for
   all future self-improvement.
2. **Leverage the LLM Extensively:** Use the LLM for *everything* possible: code generation, code analysis, testing,
   documentation, plan generation, design decisions, and even project management.
3. **Prioritize Core Functionality:** Focus on the essential features first: Notes, Plans, Agents, Tools, and the basic
   execution loop. Defer advanced features until the system can help build them itself.
4. **Automate Everything:** Automate as much of the development process as possible, including testing, code formatting,
   and deployment.
5. **Iterative and Incremental:**  Build the system in small, manageable steps. Test frequently. Refactor continuously.
6. **Self-Reflection:**  Make self-reflection and self-improvement a core part of the development process from the very
   beginning.
7. **Strategic Human Intervention:**  While minimizing human effort is the goal, strategic human intervention is still
   necessary, especially in the early stages. This includes:
    * Defining the initial seed description (Primordial Note).
    * Writing the hardcoded Ur-Agent.
    * Reviewing and correcting critical LLM-generated code.
    * Guiding the system's learning by providing feedback and setting priorities.
    * Resolving ambiguities and handling edge cases that the system can't handle on its own.
8. **Fail Fast.** Expect errors and failures, use the system to recover from these.
9. **Document as Notes.** Project documentation is done as Notes.

**Development Plan (Stages & Tasks)**

This plan is structured in stages, with each stage building upon the previous one. Within each stage, tasks are listed
in approximate priority order, but this can be adjusted dynamically by the system itself.

**Stage 0: Seed Creation (Primarily Human Effort)**

* **Task 0.1:** Define the initial `seedDescription` (JSON content for the Primordial Note). This includes:
    * Natural language description of Netention.
    * JSON Schemas for core concepts (Note, Plan, PlanStep, Message, Tool, Agent, Domain).
    * Descriptions of initial tools (`code_generation`, `file_write`, `user_interaction`, `self_reflection`).
    * Initial "Evolve Netention" plan (very basic).
    * Constraints and evolutionary rules.
    * Example Tasks.
* **Task 0.2:** Write the hardcoded `BootstrappingAgent` (Ur-Agent) in JavaScript (Node.js). This agent must be able to:
    * Parse the `seedDescription`.
    * Interact with the LLM (using a predefined API key).
    * Execute the initial tools.
    * Implement a very basic plan execution loop.
* **Task 0.3:** Set up the basic project structure (directories for `core`, `tools`, `ui`, etc.).
* **Task 0.4:** Set up LevelDB/LevelGraph for persistence.
* **Task 0.5:** Create a simple command-line interface for initializing the system (creating the Primordial Note in the
  database).
* **Task 0.6:** Set up basic logging (using Pino).

**Stage 1: Core Bootstrap (Mixed Human and LLM Effort)**

* **Goal:** Get a minimal, self-reflective loop running.
* **Human Tasks:**
    * Run the initialization script to create the Primordial Note.
    * Monitor the Ur-Agent's progress.
    * Review and correct critical LLM-generated code.
    * Provide feedback to the system.
* **System Tasks (Driven by the Ur-Agent and the "Evolve Netention" Plan):**
    * **Task 1.1:** Generate Zod schemas for all core data structures (`schemas.js`).
    * **Task 1.2:** Generate minimal `Note` class (`core/note.js`).
    * **Task 1.3:** Generate minimal `Plan` and `PlanStep` classes (`core/plan.js`).
    * **Task 1.4:** Generate minimal `Agent` class (with `think`, `act`, and simplified `run`) (`core/agent.js`).
    * **Task 1.5:** Generate minimal `Executor` class (`core/executor.js`).
    * **Task 1.6:** Implement initial tools (`tools/code_generation.js`, `tools/file_write.js`,
      `tools/user_interaction.js`, `tools/self_reflection.js`). These tools will likely be refined later.
    * **Task 1.7:** Implement basic LevelGraph integration (functions for saving and loading Notes and Plans) (
      `core/database.js`).
    * **Task 1.8:** Implement `LLMInterface` class (`core/llm.js`).
    * **Task 1.9:** Implement `MemoryManager` class (`core/memory.js`).
    * **Task 1.10:** Implement basic self-reflection (the `self_reflection` tool should be able to analyze the generated
      code and identify potential problems).
    * **Task 1.11:** Begin generating basic unit tests for the core components.

**Stage 2: Capability Expansion (Primarily System Effort)**

* **Goal:** Expand the system's capabilities to the point where it can manage most of the development process itself.
* **Human Tasks:**
    * Monitor progress and provide high-level guidance.
    * Review and approve major architectural changes.
* **System Tasks:**
    * **Task 2.1:** Refactor and improve the core classes (`Note`, `Plan`, `Agent`, `Executor`).
    * **Task 2.2:** Implement full plan execution logic (including dependencies, prioritization, and resource
      management).
    * **Task 2.3:** Create new tools:
        * `search` (web search)
        * `read_file` (read file contents)
        * `summarize` (text summarization)
        * ... (and others, as needed)
    * **Task 2.4:** Implement `PromptManager` and create a library of prompt templates.
    * **Task 2.5:** Implement full memory management (summarization, archiving, forgetting).
    * **Task 2.6:** Create a basic command-line UI for interacting with Notes and Plans.
    * **Task 2.7:** Expand the testing framework and generate more comprehensive tests.
    * **Task 2.8:** Implement error handling and recovery mechanisms.
    * **Task 2.9:** Begin documenting the codebase (using Notes!).
    * **Task 2.10:** Add a `Scheduler`.

**Stage 3: Self-Improvement and Autonomous Evolution (Almost Entirely System Effort)**

* **Goal:**  Achieve a high degree of autonomy, with the system continuously improving itself and adding new features.
* **Human Tasks:**
    * Provide occasional high-level guidance and feedback.
    * Monitor for unexpected behavior or safety issues.
* **System Tasks:**
    * **Task 3.1:** Continuously refactor and optimize the codebase.
    * **Task 3.2:** Continuously improve the plan execution, prioritization, and resource management algorithms.
    * **Task 3.3:** Develop new tools and features based on user needs and internal analysis.
    * **Task 3.4:** Improve the user interface.
    * **Task 3.5:** Enhance security and robustness.
    * **Task 3.6:** Generate and maintain documentation.
    * **Task 3.7:** Explore and implement advanced concepts (e.g., modifying the metamodel, adaptive prompt
      engineering).
    * **Task 3.8:** Generate increasingly complex and comprehensive tests.

**Minimizing Human Effort: Specific Techniques**

* **Prompt Engineering:**  Craft highly detailed and specific prompts for the LLM, including:
    * Clear instructions.
    * Relevant context (existing code, schemas, seed description).
    * Constraints and requirements.
    * Examples (where appropriate).
    * Requests for self-explanation (ask the LLM to explain its reasoning).
* **Automated Code Evaluation:**
    * Use a JavaScript linter (e.g., ESLint) to check for syntax errors and style issues.
    * Generate unit tests automatically (using the LLM).
    * Use the LLM to analyze code for potential bugs, security vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks.
    * Implement static analysis tools (eventually, built by the system itself).
* **Test-Driven Development (Automated):**  Encourage the system to generate tests *before* generating code. This helps
  to ensure that the code meets the requirements.
* **Continuous Integration (Conceptual):**  As the system evolves, implement a conceptual CI/CD pipeline, where changes
  are automatically tested and integrated into the codebase.
* **Self-Documentation:** The system should generate and maintain its own documentation (as Notes). This includes:
    * Code comments.
    * API documentation.
    * User guides.
    * Explanations of design decisions.
* **Meta-Prompting:**  Use prompts that ask the LLM to improve its own prompting strategies. For example: "Analyze the
  previous prompts and responses. How could the prompts be improved to get better results?".
* **Automated Task Breakdown:** The system will automatically break large tasks into small sub-tasks.

**Development Roadmap Summary:**

This plan outlines a path towards a self-evolving Netention, minimizing human effort by:

1. **Rapid Bootstrapping:** Quickly establishing a minimal, self-reflective core.
2. **LLM-Driven Development:**  Leveraging the LLM for most code generation, analysis, and testing.
3. **Continuous Self-Improvement:** Making self-reflection and self-modification a core part of the system's behavior.
4. **Strategic Automation:** Automating as much of the development process as possible.

This approach allows for a highly efficient and adaptable development process, where the system itself becomes the
primary engine of its own growth. Human effort is focused on high-level guidance and strategic intervention, rather than
low-level coding. The system will progressively generate its own tests, documentation, and even design specifications.
