Below are suggested user activities for **Netention v5** that demonstrate its scope and power immediately after setup.
These activities leverage the console UI, integrated Notes, and Tools to showcase the system’s recursive, self-evolving
nature, task management, code generation, reflection, and UI capabilities. Each activity is designed to be initiated via
the console prompt, highlighting the system’s flexibility and intelligence from the first run.

# **Netention v5: User Activities**

## **1. Task Planning and Execution**

- **Activity**: Create and execute a daily task plan.
- **Input**: `spawn task "Plan my day"`
- **Outcome**:
    - Spawns a `task-plan-my-day-<timestamp>` Note with `state: pending`.
    - `code_gen` generates a `logic` chain:
        - Step 1: Prompt LLM to list tasks (e.g., "Email team, Write report").
        - Step 2: Spawn sub-Notes for each task (`task-email-team-<timestamp>`).
    - UI shows:
      ```
      ● root (...) [100]
        ├─ ● task-plan-my-day-123 (...) [50]
           ├─ ● task-email-team-124 (...) [50]
           └─ ○ task-write-report-125 (...) [50]
      Log:
      🟢 task-plan-my-day-123: Spawned sub-tasks
      ```
- **Power**: Recursive task breakdown, dynamic prioritization.

## **2. Code Generation and Extension**

- **Activity**: Generate a new Tool to summarize text.
- **Input**: `spawn task "Create a summarize tool"`
- **Outcome**:
    - Spawns `task-create-summarize-tool-<timestamp>`.
    - `code_gen` generates a Tool Note:
      ```json
      {
        "id": "tool-summarize-<timestamp>",
        "content": { "type": "tool", "name": "summarize", "desc": "Summarize text", "execute": "langChain.summarize" },
        "state": { "status": "running", "priority": 60 }
      }
      ```
    - UI updates:
      ```
      ● root (...) [100]
        ├─ ● tool-summarize-123 (...) [60]
      Log:
      🟢 task-create-summarize-tool-123: Tool generated
      ```
- **Power**: Self-extension via code generation, immediate usability.

## **3. Self-Reflection and Optimization**

- **Activity**: Reflect on system state to optimize priorities.
- **Input**: `spawn task "Reflect on active Notes"`
- **Outcome**:
    - Spawns `task-reflect-on-active-notes-<timestamp>`.
    - `reflect` Tool analyzes active Notes, adjusts priorities (e.g., boosts `ui-tree` to 90).
    - UI reflects changes:
      ```
      ● root (...) [100]
        ├─ ● ui-tree (...) [90]  // Priority increased
      Log:
      🟢 task-reflect-on-active-notes-123: Priorities updated
      ```
- **Power**: Autonomous self-optimization, adaptive behavior.

## **4. Interactive UI Control**

- **Activity**: Pause and resume system execution.
- **Input**: `pause` then `resume`
- **Outcome**:
    - `ui-prompt` spawns `task-pause-<timestamp>` and `task-resume-<timestamp>`.
    - `ui_control` updates `ui-status.content.paused`.
    - UI shows:
      ```
      Netention v5 - PAUSED
      ● root (...) [100]  // No new activity
      Log:
      ⏸️ ui-control: System paused
      ```
      Then:
      ```
      Netention v5 - RUNNING
      ● root (...) [100]
      Log:
      ▶️ ui-control: System resumed
      ```
- **Power**: Real-time control, seamless UI integration.

## **5. Knowledge Capture and Logging**

- **Activity**: Log a quick note for later use.
- **Input**: `spawn task "Log meeting notes: Discussed project timeline"`
- **Outcome**:
    - Spawns `task-log-meeting-notes-<timestamp>`.
    - Adds memory Note via `saveMemory`:
      ```json
      {
        "id": "memory-log-meeting-notes-<timestamp>",
        "content": "Discussed project timeline",
        "context": ["task-log-meeting-notes-<timestamp>"]
      }
      ```
    - UI logs:
      ```
      Log:
      🟢 task-log-meeting-notes-123: Discussed project timeline
      ```
- **Power**: Persistent knowledge capture, memory integration.

## **6. Recursive System Growth**

- **Activity**: Bootstrap a new subsystem (e.g., project management).
- **Input**: `spawn system "Project Management"`
- **Outcome**:
    - Spawns `system-project-management-<timestamp>`.
    - `code_gen` generates sub-Notes (e.g., `task-create-project`, `tool-track-progress`).
    - UI expands:
      ```
      ● root (...) [100]
        ├─ ● system-project-management-123 (...) [80]
           ├─ ● task-create-project-124 (...) [50]
           └─ ○ tool-track-progress-125 (...) [60]
      Log:
      🟢 system-project-management-123: Subsystem spawned
      ```
- **Power**: Recursive subsystem creation, infinite scalability.

## **Why These Activities**

- **Scope**: Span task management, code generation, reflection, UI control, logging, and growth.
- **Power**: Demonstrate recursion, autonomy, and real-time interaction.
- **Immediate**: All executable via console prompt post-setup, showcasing system capabilities from the start.
